Analysis of a company suppliers 

Data Analysis bootcamp. 
In this project I represent an analysis for babington company to find solutions to increase the sales.
An analysis to investigate the season with the lowest period of sales, areas in the world to target potential customers or the shipping method most popular between the customers and so on. 
For this analysis I have import csv data from excel from babington suppliers. Then clean the data. And finally represent my project ideas based on excel with charts, pivottables including hypothesis and correlations of trends on excel.
